							<h2>About me</h2>
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic08.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								I love Gol’s. The flavour of the broth, the meat, and the texture of the noodles is just so good. Imagine my surprise when I found out they had a Gol’s in Montreal too. Apparently it was the first Gol’s in Canada before they started expanding out of Montreal. They had less noodle thickness options, but otherwise it tastes just like any other Gol’s.

								<h2>Preamble</h2>
								<p>I haven’t been to Europe, but just based on the vibes I think this comparison could be accurate: the churches, the food, hundreds of cafes, and of course, countless smokers every block.</p>

							<p><b>Fall 2024</b> - I had just started an internship for this term, and when I found out that not only did my friend live in Montreal, but the company I worked for had an office in Montreal, I immediately bought my flight tickets. And thus on the 27th of September, my trip to Montreal began.</p>
							<p>The streets of Montreal sure were different from Toronto’s. Everything seemed to slow a lot slower, and people seemed to move about at a slower pace. When I walk around Toronto, I always feel like I’m trying to get from point A to B as fast as I can. A change of pace adds a lot of the relaxation that one might be looking for in a trip like this.<br/>
								The subways felt a lot different too. A lot of the stations in Montreal had a distinct 80s/90s feel. A mix of brutalism but with some more flair. Did you know that the Montreal subway trains run on bus wheels? You can definitely feel it when riding. It felt like you were on rubber wheels and not metal wheels scraping along the tracks. </p>
