                                    I take pride in eating healthy, but I’ll admit I often stick to what I know: familiar proteins (beef, pork, poultry, fish), simple carbs (rice, granola), and the standard rotation of veggies (brussels sprouts, broccoli, carrots, etc).
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    While my diet is “clean”, it’s also large. This works fine when I’m bulking, but as I shift gears towards getting lean, I need to find ways to lower my calorie intake without starving myself. I’ve been researching foods I can swap into my existing diet to keep the volume high but the calories low. Here’s what I found.
                                </p>

                                <header>
                                    <h2>Calorie Density</h2>
                                </header>
                                <p>
                                    <span class="image right"><img class="image_overlay js-dynamic-image" data-filename="konjac.png" alt="Konjac noodles" /></span>
                                    
                                    When it comes to immediate calorie reduction, the single best way is to find foods that are light in calories.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Olive oil and butter are 7-8.5 calories per gram. </li>
                                        <li>Carrots which are 0.4 calories per gram. </li>
                                    </ul>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    This means we can substitute dense foods for lighter versions to eat the same size bowl of food for a fraction of the calorie cost. Of course, this goes the other way too - eat denser foods to gain weight. Try not to go overboard with that though, since Uranium-235 is an amazing 20 million calories per gram, but eat that and you’ll have bigger problems than your waistline.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I’ve started leaning into watery vegetables. Cucumbers and zucchini are 95% water. Konjac noodles are over 97% water and take on the flavour of whatever you cook them in. I also recently discovered kelp noodles (again, 90%+ water), which have a great crunch. These are “free” foods, meaning you can eat a whole lot before reaching your caloric limit.
                                </p>

                                    <h2>Fibre and Protein Content</h2>
                                </header>
                                <p>
                                    <span class="image left"><img class="image_overlay js-dynamic-image" data-filename="chia.png" alt="Chia seeds that have been soaked in water" /></span>

                                    Calorie density isn’t all, and if it was, I could probably find you a boatload of people drinking water for lunch. We need satiety (the feeling of being full). Let’s take a look at fibre - independent of calories, foods have varying amounts of it. Fiber slows down the rate at which food leaves your stomach. Soluble fiber absorbs water to form a gel (think of chia seeds expanding in water), adding physical bulk to your meal. This slow digestion keeps blood sugar stable, preventing those sudden hunger spikes an hour after eating.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    So what are some foods that are high in fibre? From my research at least, anything with more than 10 grams of fibre per 100 grams is considered pretty good. 
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Top step: Chia seeds (34g per 100g) and flax seeds (27g) </li>
                                        <li>Legumes like kidney beans, lentils, chickpeas (8g) </li>
                                        <li>Most green veggies (broccoli, spinach) are actually quite low in fibre (&lt;4g). They are good for you of course, but not the fibre powerhouses I thought they were.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Proteins are naturally more difficult for us to digest, so it spends more time sitting around in the stomach before it’s gone. Digested proteins also trigger specific hormones (the “aminostatic hypothesis”) that signal to the brain to stop eating. As the proteins break down, the level of amino acids in your blood rises which generally correspond to increased satiety and reduced hunger.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    There’s some debate online about whether animal or plant based protein is more filling. One study found that plant protein was more satiating, while anecdotes say steak wins. The truth is likely in the volume. Plant proteins like lentils usually come with fiber and bulk, filling the stomach physically. Animal proteins are denser, but take more energy to break down. Whatever the truth may be, proteins, no matter the source, are an important player when it comes to making you full, and keeping it that way. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I mentioned just now that food takes energy to break down. This is known as the “thermic effect of food”. Basically, your body generates a lot of heat when breaking food down into nutrients we can absorb. Digesting the food we eat accounts for about 10% of our daily energy intake. The energy required to digest each macronutrient are:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Fats: 0-3% </li>
                                        <li>Carbohydrates (including fibres): 5-10% </li>
                                        <li>Proteins: 20-30%</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    So if you just ate 1000 calories worth of steak, your body might spend 200-300 calories just digesting it. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Before I end this section off, I think it’s worth noting some foods that are low in fibre. First off, pretty much all proteins. This can include land meat, seafood, eggs, and dairy. Grains are also pretty low in fibre, so think rice, flour-based products (bread, pasta, etc), and processed cereals (breakfast cereals). 
                                </p>

                                    <h2>Glycemic Index and Caffeine Intake</h2>
                                </header>
                                <p>
                                    <span class="image right"><img class="image_overlay js-dynamic-image" data-filename="GI_index.jpg" alt="GI index chart - lower is better" /></span>

                                    The glycemic index (GI) measures how fast food raises blood sugar levels. High GI foods (>70 - white rice, sugar) spikes your blood sugar. Low GI foods (&lt;55 - chickpeas, quinoa) provide steady levels of blood sugar. It helps to maintain stable blood sugar levels throughout the day, reducing mid-afternoon slumps and sleepiness. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    As a little bonus factoid, we already know that caffeine plays a large role in wakefulness, but what should be highlighted is that caffeine crashes exist too. If you find yourself eating low GI foods, but still very sleepy in the afternoon, you might be experiencing a caffeine crash. More on this soon. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Now, this isn’t to say avoid caffeine at all costs, the way that you get your caffeine ultimately affects how you get to spend your day. Let’s take a look at the world’s most popular beverage: coffee. Here, I’ll talk specifically about espresso as it's the base for many drinks and also has the highest caffeine content. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Espresso (and all coffee actually) is a solution - caffeine is extracted into the water, and when it hits your stomach, it quickly enters the bloodstream. From there, the caffeine enters the brain and gives you a large spike in energy by blocking brain receptors for adenosine (a chemical promoting sleepiness) and triggering adrenaline release. When the caffeine fades off and the adrenaline wears out, the accumulated adenosine floods the receptors causing a sharp drop in energy.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <span class="image left"><img class="image_overlay js-dynamic-image" data-filename="matcha.jpg" alt="A matcha latte I made a few months back" /></span>

                                    Another popular caffeine drink these days is matcha. Matcha also has a relatively high amount of caffeine (~60-80% that of espresso), but the way it interacts with the body is different. Matcha is ground-up tea leaves, so when it enters the body, it needs to be digested in order for the caffeine to start entering the bloodstream. At the same time, matcha also releases an amino acid called L-theanine, which suppresses the adrenaline response of the caffeine. Not only is the caffeine released slower, but L-theanine prevents the shaky-jittery response that chugging coffee often brings. This slow absorption of caffeine ultimately allows you to stay awake for longer, and also avoid the whole sleepy crash mid-afternoon.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    One last thing on caffeine I want to touch on is its effect on appetite. The research and personal anecdotes on this vary wildly, so hard facts won’t be found here. What can be said though, is that some people find that drinking coffee actually reduces hunger and appetite. Other sources say that because caffeine increases blood sugar, we actually feel more hunger. From personal experience, I find that a 10am coffee can suppress my hunger enough that I simply forget to eat lunch until I find myself super hungry at 3pm. You might feel no effect, you might experience the opposite. So I’d recommend experimenting with caffeine - see if it’s something that can help suppress your hunger for easier dieting. 
                                </p>

                                    It’s important to make sure that your calories give you the nutrients you need. If food A is going to take up 400 calories worth of space, make sure it’s giving you the nutrients to match. For example, a cup of white rice is ~200 calories, but offers next to no vitamins/minerals. A cup of quinoa is the same ~200 calories, but comes with magnesium, iron, and zinc. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Not only does quinoa give you 10x the fibre content compared to white rice, it’s a very good source of other vitamins and minerals, all for the same amount of calories. 
                                </p>

                                    <h2>Resistant Starch</h2>
                                </header>
                                <p>
                                    <span class="image right"><img class="image_overlay js-dynamic-image" data-filename="starch.jpg" alt="Freshly cooked starch -> Cooling -> Amylose re-forms into a crystalline structure and water leaves" /></span>

                                    As a last little bit, I wanted to cover resistant starch. This one is something I found out recently, and it’s been blowing my mind. If you cook pasta, potatoes, or rice and then cool them down in the fridge for 12+ hours, the starch changes its chemical structure. As the starch cools, they lose their cooked structure, and form a compact structure.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Resistant starch is great for so many reasons. First off, it resists digestion in the small intestine and ferments in the large intestine. What happens here is that the resistant starch acts like a prebiotic, meaning it feeds gut bacteria and produces something called Butyrate. Butyrate stimulates the release of GLP-1 (the same hormone weight-loss drugs like ozempic target). This tells your brain that you’re full. Other benefits of Butyrate is a strengthened gut lining and increased insulin sensitivity.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Another cool effect is that since the fermentation of resistant starch takes hours in the lower gut, the satiety benefits might even kick in during your next meal. If you had reheated rice for lunch, the fermentation from lunch might peak at around dinner time, letting you feel more full before you even eat. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    And yes, you read that right - reheating doesn’t affect the amount of resistant starch all that much. If you’re okay with eating your white rice the day after, this is an excellent way to increase satiety. A little earlier I mentioned that the resistant starch feeds the gut bacteria. If you’ve realised, gut bacteria isn’t exactly you, so some caloric savings can be enjoyed. Not a drastic amount - only about 10-15% (or about 1.5 calories per gram).
                                </p>

                                    Eating healthy or trying to diet doesn’t have to mean eating less food; it just means eating smarter food. By swapping low-volume foods (like oils and white rice) for high-volume, nutrient-dense options (like konjac and lentils), you can trick your body into feeling stuffed while actually eating less calories. You don’t need to adopt a strict label like “keto” or “paleo”. Change is slow and that’s okay. Just try swapping one ingredient at a time. Trade the fresh rice for day-old rice. Try some matcha instead of coffee and see how your energy levels change.

                                    Before we finish off, let’s take a look at a normal day’s diet, and a revised version based on what we just learned. The goal for this example is to eat the same amount of protein, feel just as full, but drastically cut the calories.

                                        <li>Breakfast: Greek yogurt, 1 cup raspberries, 1 tbsp chia seeds + matcha latte (270 cals) </li>
                                        <li>Lunch: Grilled mackerel (1 side) + ½ cup leftover rice + 1 cup cauliflower rice + kimchi (400 cals) </li>
                                        <li>Dinner: S&B curry, but reduce sesame oil usage from 4 tbsp (480 cals) to 1 (120 cals), and swap the potatoes for mushrooms (carbs → fibre) + 1 bowl cauliflower rice (total 400 cals)</li>
                                        <li>Snack: 3 cups popcorn (100 cals)</li>

                                    As you can see, although not much has changed in terms of the main menu, we were able to reduce the amount of calories consumed by 900. We reduced the amount of calories by about 200 from every meal, and pretty much all of that was thanks to reducing the amount of carbs like rice and potatoes. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    What’s cool is that your weight is largely dependent on calorie in versus calorie out. Let’s say your base metabolic rate is 1500 (how much calories your body burns to lay down for 24 hours). By eating only 1170 calories a day, you get to burn 330 calories simply by existing. If you did an hour of exercise and burned 300 calories, that’s a whole 630 calories deficit. If you wanted to treat yourself to a bowl of white rice, I think that’s perfectly fine. After all, a bowl of rice is 250 calories, and you’d still be down 380 calories for the day.
