								새로운 도시를 가게되면 내가 항상 그곳의 커피 세상에 대해 할 말이 많아요. 대화에 커피 주제가 뜬다면, 나는 무조건 스페셜티 커피에대해서 이야기를 나눕니다. 
								내가 블로그를 쓸때 스페셜티 커피를 설명하자면 너무 많은 공간을 차지하기 때문에 이렇게 커피 전용 페이지를 만들게 되었다. 하지만 너무나 다양한 내용을 다루려고 하기 때문에, 
								아주 자세히 또는 깊이 들어가진 않겠다.

							<!-- === Countries of Origin === -->
							<h2 id="origin">원산지 국가</h2>

							<p>
								커피는 안정적인 온도를 지닌 열대 환경에서 잘자란다. 이런 이유로 브라질, 페루, 에티오피아, 케냐, 베트남에서 많이 재배를 하고있고, 최근에는 중국 윈난주에서도 커피를 키운다고한다. 
								이 모든 커피들은 각 유니크한 풍미 프로필을 가지고있다.
							</p>

							<div class="image main"><img class="image_overlay" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/sc-travel-blog/Coffee/map.png" alt="Map of where coffee grows" /></div>

							<p>
								높은 고도에서 자라는 커피는 느린 성숙에 인해 더많은 당성분을 개발하면서, 밝은 산미와 향기로운 복잡성을 자랑한다. 낮은 고도의 커피들은 마일드하면서 흙내음이 더 강력하고, 산미가 덜하다. 

								물론 식물이면 흙 종류가 성장과 맛에 큰 역할맡는다. 에티오피아 또는 중앙아메리카에서는 화산토 (칼륨과 인이 풍부함)가 커피 재배에 특히 유리한 조건을 제공한다. 이 흙의 구성 
								(따라서 영양소 밀도)은 원두의 밀도외 당도에 영향을 끼치며, 약산성 흙이(pH 6-6.5) 제일 좋다.
							</p>

							<hr />

							<!-- === Species of Coffee === -->
							<h2 id="species">커피의 종 (種)</h2>

							<p><span class="image right"><img class="image_overlay" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/sc-travel-blog/Coffee/pie_chart.png" alt="Market share of species" /></span>
								커피백이나 카페에 “100% Arabica”라고 쓰인거 혹시 본적있나요? Arabica (아라비카)는 세계의 커피종 중 하나이다. 아라비카가 세계 시장의 60-70%를 차지하고 있고, 
								Robusta (로부스타)가 또 30-40%를 차차한다고한다. 남은 1-3%은 Liberia (리베리아)나 Stenophylla (스테노필라) 같이 훨씬 작은 종이 차지한다. 시장 점유율이 낮아서 
								우리가 모르고 놓치고 있던 정말 흥미로운 풍미를 가지고 있을수도 있다는게 아주 안타깝다. 
								“까먹힌 커피”라고 불리는 <a href="https://perfectdailygrind.com/2020/12/what-is-coffea-stenophylla/">Coffea Stenophylla</a> (코페아 스테노필라)도 찾아 보세요.
							</p>

							<p>
								이젠 제데로 아라비카랑 로부스타에 대해 말해볼까요?
							</p>

							<p>
								<b><i>Coffea Arabica</i></b> (코페아 아라비카)는 풍미랑 당도로 알려져있고, 마일드하고 부드러운 커피이다. 아라비카는 시원한 열대환경이 필요하고, 
								높은 고도 (1000 - 2000 미터) 에서 자라야한다. 로부스타에 비해 수확량이 적고, 해충과 rust (러스트;곰팡이 감염)에 더 취약하다.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b><i>Coffea Canephora</i></b> (코페아 카네포라)또는 로부스타는 이 두 종 사이에 “더 강한” (카페인 양이 더 많다) 커피이다. 로부스타는 더 쓰고, 입맛이 두껍고, 풍미가 덜하다. 
								이 종은 낮은 고도 (0 - 700 미터)에서 자라고, 혹독한 환경과 기후 속에서도 잘 자란다. 이것에 더해 러스트에 피해가 적고, 거의 2배의 카페인 덕분에 해충류도 적다. 
							</p>
							<p>
								이렇게 아라비카랑 로부스타를 잠깐 봤을 때는 로부스타가 1등 자리를 차지해야 된다라고 생각할수도 있다. 그 이유는 더욱더 강력하고, 카페인도 많고, 그리고 키울때도 쉽기 때문이다. 
								하지만, 아라비카가 로부스타보다 시장 점유율이 거의 2배에 달하는 이유는 풍미가 훨씬 뛰어나서 그렇다. 로부스타는 또한 더 쓴맛이 나고 수렴성이 더 강하기 때문에 고급 양조에는 덜 
								매력적이다. 카페외에, 인스턴트나 대형체인점에서 로부스타를 사용한다.
							</p>

							<!-- === Coffee Varietals === -->
							<h2 id="varietals">커피 품종</h2>
							<p>
								커피 품종 (varietal)은 한 종 안에서 나눠지는 아종 이라고 볼 수 있습니다. 예를 들어, 어떤 사과나무는 빨간 사과를 맺고, 또 다른 나무는 초록 사과를 맺는 것과 비슷하죠. 
								이처럼 품종에 따라 다양한 tasting note, 단맛, 섬세함, 그리고 바디감을 표현할 수 있는 체리를 재배할 수 있는 기회를 생산자에게 제공한다. 커피가 어디서, 어떤 환경에서 
								자랐는지도 커피 체리의 풍미에 큰 영향을 미치는 종요한 요소이다. 아래는 요즘 많이 재배되고 있는 인기 풍종들 중 일부이다.

							<!-- === Processing Raw Coffee === -->
							<h2 id="processing">Processing Raw Coffee</h2>
							<p>
								Great job - you’ve successfully grown a batch of some high-quality coffee cherries. But now we have to process them; get them to a state where 
								we can start to roast these coffee beans. Coffee processing removes the coffee seed from the pulp, mucilage, and parchment.
							</p>
							<div class="image main"><img class="image_overlay" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/sc-travel-blog/Coffee/bean_anatomy.png" alt="Bean anatomy" /></div>
							<p>
								There’s three main coffee processing methods these days: natural, washed, and honey processes. Each of these methods change the sweetness, body, 
								and the acidity of the coffee. 
							</p>


							<dl>
								<dt>Washed</dt>
								<dd>
									<p>Coffee cherries first undergo a density test, where cherries that sink in water are chosen. These cherries are depulped (all non-bean parts are removed) 
										and set to ferment in a tank of water from anywhere between 18 to 72 hours. This fermentation stage helps to break down the cherry’s mucilage, 
										changing the bean’s flavour profile. The beans are now set to dry until they reach a moisture content of around 11%. Washed coffees tend to have a 
										bright acidity with white wine undertones. Think citrus, floral, green apple, and tea.</p>
								</dd>
								<dt>Natural</dt>
								<dd>
									<p>The natural, or dry, process involves spreading the coffee cherries in a thin layer across a flat surface under the sun. For 3 to 6 weeks, 
										farmers rake the beans back and forth throughout the day to prevent mold. During this time, the coffee beans ferment, allowing the sugars 
										and mucilage to latch onto the beans. Once they reach 11% moisture levels, the beans are depulped and then stored. Natural coffees often 
										have fruity and sweet tasting notes. Common descriptors include berries (blueberry, strawberry, etc), tropical fruits, molasses, and dark chocolate. </p>
								</dd>
								<dt>Honey</dt>
								<dd>
									<p>When done correctly, the honey process combines the best of washed and natural processes. The process involves depulping first, leaving a 
										small amount of mucilage left on the beans. Once dried, the remaining mucilage is removed and the beans are stored. Oftentimes, honey 
										processed coffees are referred to by colors - black, red, and yellow. These colors are often how much mucilage is left on the bean after 
										depulping; black with the most, and white with the least. Yellow honey gives mild fruit, citrus, and floral; red honey gives a sweeter red 
										fruit and brown sugar; black honey is the sweetest, having jammy fruit and a full body flavour. </p>
								</dd>
							</dl>

							<div class="image main"><img class="image_overlay" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/sc-travel-blog/Coffee/process.png" alt="Beans before depulping" /></div>

							<p>
								Once processing is complete, the potential for flavour is set - no new flavours develop in our bean from this point on. What follows from here though, 
								is the highlighting of these flavours and tasting notes through roasting and brewing. Let’s grab our bag of green beans and move onto the next section.
							</p>

							<hr />

							<!-- === Roasting Coffee === -->
							<h2 id="roasting">Roasting Coffee</h2>
							<p><span class="image right"><img class="image_overlay" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/sc-travel-blog/Coffee/roasting.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>
									Roasting coffee is an incredibly complex task; you need to know the bean density and hardness, preheating, airflow patterns, drumspeed, 
									cooling, and so many more variables (RoR curve?? Development time???). To be honest, roasting beans is far above my coffee nerd paygrade, 
									so here’s just the basics.
								</p>
							</p>

							<p>
								During roasting, green coffee beans are poured into a large rotating drum filled with hot air. The air ensures even heat distribution, 
								while the spinning drum keeps these beans moving so they roast uniformly such that they don’t burn. As these beans heat up, they change physically 
								and chemically; at around 196°C (385°F), a popping sound called the first crack is heard. This signals that the beans have reached a light roast. 
								From here, roasting longer produces a medium roast (often ending before the second crack), and dark roasts go well into the second crack or past 
								it (around 224°C / 435°F).
							</p>

							<dl>
								<dt>Light</dt>
								<dd>
									<p>The choice for specialty coffee - light roasts preserve the bean’s origin and process characteristics. Compared to the darker roasts, 
										these coffees have more acidity and can offer more unique flavours as they haven’t been roasted away. </p>
								</dd>
								<dt>Medium</dt>
								<dd>
									<p>The step between light and dark roasts. It’s a common roast profile with a more rounded flavour profile. While this roast still 
										preserves most of the unique flavours, it starts to develop more of the “standard” bitter coffee taste. A darker medium roast is 
										sometimes called a “city roast”.</p>
								</dd>
								<dt>Dark</dt>
								<dd>
									<p>Low acidity, heavy body, and thicker mouthfeel. Has very little of their origin characteristics left, but pronounced smoky
										and nutty flavours of these coffees are enjoyed by some. Pro tip, if you're in Japan (particularly around Nagoya), try to find
										a cafe that serves Ogura toast. Medium-dark and dark roasts pair incredibly well with these thick slices of toast, lathered with
										butter and sweet red bean paste.</p>
								</dd>
							</dl>

							<div class="image main"><img class="image_overlay" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/sc-travel-blog/Coffee/roast_levels.png" alt="Roast levels. Image from Hoffman's roasting video" /></div>

							<p>
								Now I might be a little biased, but doesn’t light roast sound great? It preserves the natural characteristics of coffee and it’s a whole lot 
								less bitter. Unfortunately light roasts lose when it comes to financial cost. In terms of shelf stability, while dark roasts degas faster 
								(release CO2 more quickly; too much loss = loss of flavour), that also means they achieve a flavour equilibrium sooner. Dark roasts also mask 
								inconsistencies, making it easier to cover up lower-grade beans with dark roast’s characteristic bold, bitter, and smoky notes. The consistency 
								of dark roasts make it the optimal choice for commercial coffee companies like Starbucks, Tim Hortons, and instant coffee manufacturers. Even in 
								brewing, dark roasts are more forgiving; they’re less sensitive to grind size or water temperature variations, which helps to ensure a decent cup 
								without trying too hard.
							</p>
							<p>
								Because companies have been preferring dark roasts for most of the history of coffee, people have eventually come to associate the flavour of coffee to 
								that of a dark roast. It also came with the unfortunate notion that darker and more bitter coffees are stronger, which is 
								untrue; roasting for longer doesn’t magically create more caffeine, and in fact actually burns some of it off. 
							</p>

							<p>
								Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6BJVM5tvnw">James Hoffman’s video</a> on roasting for a more thorough understanding of the whole roasting process. 
							</p>

							<hr />


							<!-- === Resting Coffee === -->
							<h2 id="resting">Resting Coffee</h2>
							<p>
								Before your freshly roasted coffee can be used, we must go through a process of resting it. We do this because the coffee, after its long journey to 
								get to this point, is tired and must take a little break before becoming hot bean soup in your cup. Probably not. When green coffee is roasted, it 
								releases moisture and traps pockets of CO2 inside the bean. As time passes, the beans gradually degas and the CO2 escapes. This is the reason why 
								many coffee bags come with a small circle in the back; a one-way valve to release gas. I mentioned earlier that too much loss = loss of flavour, 
								but also if there’s too much CO2, we get a very sour and highly acidic flavour in our coffee. It’s for this reason coffee is generally rested 
								anywhere from 7 to 14 days past the roast date, though some roasters might recommend some other range. You’ll notice that specialty bags of coffee 
								will list the roast date rather than the best-by date because it's inherently more useful info to have if you want the best coffee. 
							</p>

							<hr />


							<!-- === Brewing Coffee === -->
							<h2 id="brewing">Brewing Coffee</h2>
							<p>
								When it comes to brewing our coffee, we have a lot of options, but I'll only be covering the main three. 
								I’ll cover these methods very briefly, and dive deeper into them after.
							</p>

							<dl>
								<dt>Espresso</dt>
								<dd>
									<p>When you take a bit of finely ground coffee, pack it down tight, and push hot water through it at about 9 bars of pressure, what comes 
										out is a small, intense shot of coffee called espresso. Generally 16-20 grams of coffee in, and 32-40 grams of liquid out for a 
										double-shot. People drink this as is, or combine it with various ingredients to get a drink they might prefer. More on this later.</p>
								</dd>
								<dt>Percolation Brewing</dt>
								<dd>
									<p>Percolation brewing is a more hands-on method where hot water is poured over coffee grounds and allowed to drip through, 
										producing brewed coffee one drop at a time.</p>
								</dd>
								<dt>Immersion Brewing</dt>
								<dd>
									<p>With immersion, the coffee grounds hang out in a tub of hot water, slowly releasing its flavour. Like steeping tea, once finished, the 
										grounds are separated out and a cup of joe is produced. </p>
								</dd>
							</dl>

							<hr />


							<!-- === Espresso === -->
							<h2 id="espresso">Espresso</h2>
							<p>
								Espresso is actually a recent revelation when looking into coffee’s history. Coffee is believed to have been first made in Ethiopia in the 9th 
								century, but espresso only came into existence around 1900. Brewing espresso can be quite the task depending on how deep into the coffee rabbit 
								hole someone is. At coffee shops where baristas can’t afford the time, they will most likely simply grind the coffee into the portafilter basket, 
								tamp it (flatten the mound of coffee and compact it), and throw it into the machine for its 9 bar shower. 
							</p>

							<div class="image main"><img class="image_overlay" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/sc-travel-blog/Coffee/espresso_tools.png" alt="" /></div>

							<p>
								Coffee nerds like yours truly follow a much more complicated process. A lot of tools and variables come into play when pulling a shot. Dialing in 
								the brew isn’t something I’ll go over in this article, but to satiate your thirst for knowledge, I’ll list off a few things that we might be interested in.
							</p>

							</details>
							

							<p><span class="image right"><img class="image_overlay" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/sc-travel-blog/Coffee/espresso.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Finally, a shot of espresso is born. It’s beautiful; the rich orange crema and how dense it looks, the way it mixes into the espresso. Remember 
									the part about degassing after roasting? Crema is actually the CO2 from the beans. The fresher the coffee, the more CO2 is generally produced - 
									but as explained before, crema being CO2, can actually make the coffee taste sour if there’s too much of it.</p>
							</p>

							<p>
								Some people like to enjoy espresso as-is, but I find that adding some steamed milk can help to bring out the tasting notes that are otherwise 
								buried behind espresso’s strong acidity/bitterness. Milk, when warmed to around 60 C, becomes sweeter and smoother as a result of its lactose 
								breaking down into simpler sugars like glucose. But past this point (70 C+), the milk proteins can break down and start to produce sulfurous, 
								egg-like odors. Steaming milk is also a topic that I don’t plan on going over here.
							</p>

							<p><span class="image left"><img class="image_overlay" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/sc-travel-blog/Coffee/steamed_milk.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>
									With this steamed milk, we can make a lot of drinks. Lattes, macchiatos, cappuccinos, flat whites, cortados, etc are all simply espresso + steamed milk. 
									What differentiates these is the ratio of espresso to steamed milk. Lattes are generally a 1:3-4 ratio of espresso to steamed milk. 
									Smaller drinks like cortados use a 1:1, but drinks like cappuccinos are 1:2 and with a lot more milk foam. Other popular options include 
									ice cream (affogato), whipped cream (espresso con panna), water (americano), and even with ladyfinger biscuits to produce tiramisu.
								</p>
							</p><br>

							<!-- === Percolation Brewing === -->
							<h2 id="percolation">Percolation Brewing</h2>
							<p><span class="image right"><img class="image_overlay" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/sc-travel-blog/Coffee/v60.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>
									Also referred to as drip brewing/coffee or a pour over, hot water is added in stages over a period of a few minutes along with some sporadic 
									agitation to improve extraction. Popular brewing materials for percolation include Hario’s V60 Dripper, or the Chemex. The grind size for 
									percolation brewing is larger than that of espresso, but generally the same total amount of coffee is used to get a cup of coffee 
									(pour over typically uses 5-6 grams per 100 mL). Percolation brewing has its own complicated variables like what shape the cone is, 
									blooming, filter quality, agitation methods, and even how to pour the water into the bed of coffee. 
								</p>
							</p>

							<p>
								As a quick note, blooming is the first pour in brewing, where just enough water is added to cover the coffee grounds to release CO2 from the 
								grounds for better flavour later. 
							</p>

							<hr />


							<!-- === Immersion Brewing === -->
							<h2 id="immersion">Immersion Brewing</h2>
							<p>
								Immersion brewing is all about letting our grounds soak and sit. The french press is the name of the game when it comes to this - just dump in the 
								coffee and add hot water. All the grounds stay in contact with the water the whole time, which makes extraction more even and a bit more 
								forgiving if the grind size or timing is off. Like with percolation brewing, there is also a blooming stage at the start. When brewing is complete, 
								the french press comes with a handy plunger that pushes all the grounds to the bottom. Since the french press uses a metal mesh here instead of 
								paper filters, the cup tends to be bolder, with more oils and a thicker mouthfeel. Lately, companies like Hario have introduced products like the 
								Switch that combine the best of percolation and immersion brewing by attaching a valve to the bottom of the cone to restrict the flow of water.
							</p>
							<div class="row">
								<div class="col-6"><span class="image fit"><img class="image_overlay" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/sc-travel-blog/Coffee/french_press.png" alt="" /></span></div>
								<div class="col-6"><span class="image fit"><img class="image_overlay" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/sc-travel-blog/Coffee/hario_switch.png" alt="" /></span></div>
							</div>

							<p>
								Various other brewing methods exist like coffee socks, cezve (Turkish coffee), cold brew, siphon, phin filter (Vietnamese drip coffee), and so many more. 
								If you’re out and come across a new brewing method, try it out! In a world where espressos and pour overs dominate the market, sometimes a 
								Vietnamese egg coffee can hit the right spot.
							</p>


							<hr />


							<!-- === Closing Notes === -->
							<h2 id="closing">Closing Notes</h2>
							<p>
								There’s still so much I haven’t been able to cover in this overview. I do want to write about how I find cafes, what I look for when buying beans, 
								and a deeper dive into dialing in espresso. This is my time writing about one of my hobbies, so I hope it was somewhat easy to follow. 
								It’s hard to determine if I’m giving too much detail or not enough. I’ll come to learn the more I write, so do stay tuned!

								If there’s any takeaway from having read all this, I hope that it’s an understanding that coffee is much more than a bitter drink that people deal 
								with just for the caffeine. There’s a world of flavour that just needs to be explored and if you’re just getting started with coffee, I’m getting 
								excited for you because there’s so much to experience and enjoy.
