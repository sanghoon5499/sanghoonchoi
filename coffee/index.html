							<h2>Why does this page exist?</h2>
							<p><span class="image left"><img class="image_overlay" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/sc-travel-blog/Coffee/coffee.png" alt="V60 pourover" /></span>
								Every time I visit a new city, I always have some lengthy paragraph of stuff to say about the coffee world there. 
								If you know me, if we’re going to be talking about coffee, it’s going to be specialty coffee. It’s hard to explain the whole idea of 
								specialty coffee without taking up a big chunk of the blog, which is exactly why I decided to create a dedicated page about it. 
								However, because I’m aiming to fit a lot of things about coffee on this page, it won’t go too in-depth with everything.

							<!-- === Country of Origin === -->
							<h2>Country of Origin</h2>

							<p>
								Coffee likes to grow in tropical environments with stable temperatures, so we often see them growing in parts of the world like 
								Brazil, Peru, Ethiopia, Kenya, Vietnam, and even in Yunnan, China these days. These coffees all have unique flavour profiles respective to their regions.
							</p>

							<div class="image main"><img class="image_overlay" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/sc-travel-blog/Coffee/map.png" alt="Map of where coffee grows" /></div>

							<p>
								Higher altitudes generally lead to slower cherry maturation, which allows more time for sugars and complex flavours to develop. 
								These higher elevation coffees also tend to have brighter acidity and more aromatic complexity (we’ll get to these fancy terms later). 
								Lower elevation often gives milder, earthier, and less acidic coffees.

								Of course, when it comes to plants, soil plays a large part. In regions like Ethiopia and Central America, volcanic soil 
								(rich in potassium and phosphorus) is quite beneficial for growing coffee. The composition of soils (and hence, their nutrient density), 
								affects bean density and sweetness, with slightly acidic soils (pH 6-6.5) being ideal.

							<!-- === Species and Varietals of Coffee === -->
							<h2>Species of Coffee</h2>

							<p><span class="image right"><img class="image_overlay" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/sc-travel-blog/Coffee/pie_chart.png" alt="Market share of species" /></span>
								Ever seen the words “100% Arabica” plastered all over a coffee shop or a bag of coffee beans? Arabica is just one species of coffee out there in the world. 
								Unfortunately, we live in a world where Arabica holds roughly 60-70% of the market, and Robusta holds another 30-40%. This leaves just 1-3% for smaller 
								species like Liberia and Stenophylla. I think it’s unfortunate because the smaller market-share coffees could be carrying some seriously interesting 
								flavours that we’ve been missing out on. See <a href="https://perfectdailygrind.com/2020/12/what-is-coffea-stenophylla/">Coffea Stenophylla</a>, known as the “Forgotten Coffee”.
							</p>

							<p>
								Let's talk about Arabica and Robusta.
							</p>

							<p>
								<b><i>Coffea Arabica</i></b>, known for its aromatic and sweeter taste, it's considered a mild and smoother coffee. The species requires a cool subtropical climate 
								and must grow at high elevation (1000 - 2000 meters). Compared to Robusta, its crop yield is also lower. On top of this, it's more susceptible to pests 
								and rust (a fungal infection). 
							</p>
							<p>
								<b><i>Coffea Canephora</i></b>, or simply Robusta, is generally known as the stronger coffee of the two. It’s more bitter, has a thicker mouthfeel, 
								and is much lower in aromatic qualities. Robusta is quite robust when talking growth conditions, requiring lower elevations (0 - 700 meters) 
								and reproducing even in harsh environments and climates. It’s also rust-resistant, has double the caffeine (less pests), and even has a higher crop yield. 
							</p>
							<p>
								All things considered, Robusta seems like it should take the top spot — it's hardier, higher in caffeine, and easier to grow. 
								But Arabica’s superior flavour profile is the main reason why it holds nearly twice the market share of Robusta. Robusta is also 
								more bitter and has greater astringency, which makes it less appealing for high-end brewing. Instead of specialty coffee shops, 
								we often see Robusta used in instant coffee or commercial blends at large chains.

							<!-- === Varietals === -->
							<h2>Varietals</h2>
							<p>
								Coffee varietals are the sub-groups within a species. Think of how one type of apple tree might produce red apples, but another grows green apples. 
								These different varietals of coffee give the producer the opportunity to grow cherries for a specific tasting note, sweetness, nuance, and body. 
								Where the coffee is grown, and in what conditions, are important factors that influence the flavours of the coffee cherry. The following are just a
								few popular varietals today.
							</p>
							<div class="table-wrapper">
								<table>
									<thead>
										<tr>
											<th>Varietal</th>
											<th>Description</th>
											<th>Tasting Notes</th>
										</tr>
									</thead>
									<tbody>
										<tr>
											<td>Typica</td>
											<td>One of the oldest cultivated Arabica varietals; the base from which many others were developed. Lower yields but good quality.</td>
											<td>Balanced, sweet, mild acidity</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>Bourbon</td>
											<td>Grown across the world, but with notable presence in Latin America. Known for better yield than Typica. Caturra is a natural mutation of Bourbon, shorter and easier to harvest.</td>

											<td>Geisha (Gesha)</td>
											<td>Originally from Ethiopia, made famous by Panama. Delicate, low-yield, and expensive to grow. Despite this, it's prized for its distinct flavour profile</td>
											<td>Floral, tea-like, citrus</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>Ethiopian Heirloom</td>
											<td>A broad category of wild and indigenous varietals found in Ethiopia, especially in regions like Yirgacheffe, which may sound familiar.</td>

							<!-- === Processing Raw Coffee === -->
							<h2>Processing Raw Coffee</h2>
							<p>
								Great job - you’ve successfully grown a batch of some high-quality coffee cherries. But now we have to process them; get them to a state where 
								we can start to roast these coffee beans. Coffee processing removes the coffee seed from the pulp, mucilage, and parchment.
							</p>
							<div class="image main"><img class="image_overlay" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/sc-travel-blog/Coffee/bean_anatomy.png" alt="Bean anatomy" /></div>
							<p>
								There’s three main coffee processing methods these days: natural, washed, and honey processes. Each of these methods change the sweetness, body, 
								and the acidity of the coffee. 
							</p>


							<dl>
								<dt>Washed</dt>
								<dd>
									<p>Coffee cherries first undergo a density test, where cherries that sink in water are chosen. These cherries are depulped and set to ferment 
										in a tank of water from anywhere between 18 to 72 hours. This fermentation stage helps to break down the cherry’s mucilage, changing the 
										bean’s flavour profile. The beans are now set to dry. Washed coffees tend to have a bright acidity with white wine undertones. 
										Think citrus, floral, green apple, and tea.</p>
								</dd>
								<dt>Natural</dt>
								<dd>
									<p>The natural, or dry, process involves spreading the coffee cherries in a thin layer across a flat surface under the sun. For 3 to 6 weeks, 
										farmers rake the beans back and forth throughout the day to prevent mold. During this time, the coffee beans ferment, allowing the sugars 
										and mucilage to latch onto the beans. Once they reach 11% moisture levels, the beans are depulped (all non-bean parts are removed) and then 
										stored. Natural coffees often have fruity and sweet tasting notes. Common descriptors include berries (blueberry, strawberry, etc), tropical 
										fruits, molasses, and dark chocolate. </p>
								</dd>
								<dt>Honey</dt>
								<dd>
									<p>When done correctly, the honey process combines the best of washed and natural processes. The process involves depulping first, leaving a 
										small amount of mucilage left on the beans. Once dried, the remaining mucilage is removed and the beans are stored. Oftentimes, honey 
										processed coffees are referred to by colors - black, red, and yellow. These colors are often how much mucilage is left on the bean after 
										depulping; black with the most, and white with the least. Yellow honey gives mild fruit, citrus, and floral; red honey gives a sweeter red 
										fruit and brown sugar; black honey is the sweetest, having jammy fruit and a full body flavour. </p>
								</dd>
							</dl>

							<div class="image main"><img class="image_overlay" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/sc-travel-blog/Coffee/process.png" alt="Beans before depulping" /></div>

							<p>
								Once processing is complete, the potential for flavour is set - no new flavours develop in our bean from this point on. What follows from here though, 
								is the highlighting of these flavours and tasting notes through roasting and brewing. Let’s grab our bag of green beans and move onto the next section.

							<!-- === Roasting Coffee === -->
							<h2>Roasting Coffee</h2>
							<p>
								Roasting coffee is an incredibly complex task; you need to know the bean density and hardness, preheating, airflow patterns, drumspeed, 
								cooling, and so many more variables (RoR curve?? Development time???). To be honest, roasting beans is far above my coffee nerd paygrade, 
								so here’s just the basics.
							</p>

							<p>
								During roasting, green coffee beans are poured into a large rotating drum filled with hot air. The air ensures even heat distribution, 
								while the spinning drum keeps these beans moving so they roast uniformly so that they don’t burn. As these beans heat up, they change physically 
								and chemically; at around 196°C (385°F), a popping sound called the first crack is heard. This signals that the beans have reached a light roast. 
								From here, roasting longer produces a medium roast (often ending before the second crack), and dark roasts go well into the second crack or past 
								it (around 224°C / 435°F).
							</p>

							<dl>
								<dt>Light</dt>
								<dd>
									<p>The choice for specialty coffee - light roasts preserve the bean’s origin and process characteristics. compared to the darker roasts, 
										these coffees are more acidic and can offer more unique flavours as they haven’t been roasted away. </p>
								</dd>
								<dt>Medium</dt>
								<dd>
									<p>The step between light and dark roasts. It’s a common roast profile with a more rounded flavour profile. While this roast still 
										preserves most of the unique flavours, it starts to develop more of the “standard” bitter coffee taste. A darker medium roast is 
										sometimes called a “city roast”.</p>
								</dd>
								<dt>Dark</dt>
								<dd>
									<p>Low acidity, heavy body, but lacks personality. Has very little of their origin characteristics left, but some may enjoy the 
										pronounced dark chocolate and nutty flavour profiles of these coffees. </p>
								</dd>
							</dl>

							<div class="image main"><img class="image_overlay" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/sc-travel-blog/Coffee/roast_levels.png" alt="Roast levels. Image from Hoffman's roasting video" /></div>

							<p>
								Now I might be a little biased, but doesn’t light roast sound great? It preserves the natural characteristics of coffee and it’s a whole lot 
								less bitter. Unfortunately light roasts lose when it comes to financial cost. In terms of shelf stability, while dark roasts degass faster 
								(release CO2 more quickly; too much loss = loss of flavour), that also means they achieve a flavour equilibrium sooner. Dark roasts also mask 
								inconsistencies, making it easier to cover up lower-grade beans with dark roast’s characteristic bold, bitter, and smoky notes. The consistency 
								of dark roasts make it the optimal choice for commercial coffee companies like Starbucks, Tim Hortons, and instant coffee manufacturers. Even in 
								brewing, dark roasts are more forgiving; they’re less sensitive to grind size or water temperature variations, which helps to ensure a decent cup 
								without trying too hard.
							</p>
							<p>
								Because companies have been preferring dark roasts for most of the history of coffee, people eventually come to associate the flavour of coffee to 
								that of a dark roast. It also came with the unfortunate side effect that darker and more bitter coffees are “stronger” (more caffeine), which is 
								untrue; roasting for longer doesn’t magically create more caffeine, and in fact actually burns some of it off. 
							</p>

							<p>
								Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6BJVM5tvnw">James Hoffman’s video</a> on roasting for a more thorough understanding of the whole roasting process.
