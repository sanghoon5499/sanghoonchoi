									<h1>Montr√©al<br />
										</h1>
									<p>The city of Montreal, east of Toronto by about 6 hours of driving. <br />
										Quebec‚Äôs largest city has a lot of history with plenty of European <br />
										(particularly French) influence. </p>

									<h2>Preamble</h2>
									<p>I haven‚Äôt been to Europe, but just based on the vibes I think this comparison could be accurate: the churches, the food, hundreds of cafes, and of course, countless smokers every block.</p>
								</header>
								<p><b>Fall 2024</b> - I had just started an internship for this term, and when I found out that not only did my friend live in Montreal, but the company I worked for had an office in Montreal, I immediately bought my flight tickets. And thus on the 27th of September, my trip to Montreal began.</p>

								</div>
								<p>The streets of Montreal sure were different from Toronto‚Äôs. Everything seemed to slow a lot slower, and people seemed to move about at a slower pace. When I walk around Toronto, I always feel like I‚Äôm trying to get from point A to B as fast as I can. A change of pace adds a lot of the relaxation that one might be looking for in a trip like this.<br/>
									The subways felt a lot different too. A lot of the stations in Montreal had a distinct 80s/90s feel. A mix of brutalism but with some more flair. Did you know that the Montreal subway trains run on bus wheels? You can definitely feel it when riding. It felt like you were on rubber wheels and not metal wheels scraping along the tracks. </p>

									<h2>Cafes</h2>
								</header>
								<p><span class="image left"><img class="image_overlay" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/sc-travel-blog/blog-montreal/croissant.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									If you know me, you won‚Äôt find it any surprising that I spent a lot of my time looking up cafes. 
									The cafes in Montreal are better than I had ever hoped. Not only were there a lot of them, but the vast majority of them were specialty cafes. <a href="../coffee.html" style="color:#A52A2A">You should check out this page if you're interested in learning a little more!</a> 
									This was already amazing, but Montreal had one more card up its sleeve; pretty much all of them were supplied with unique and local roasters. I didn‚Äôt realise there could be so many roasters in Montreal alone (or maybe they were sourced from Quebec as a whole, but my argument still stands). 
									Even in Toronto, while cafes may serve specialty coffee, you generally don‚Äôt get a lot of breadth in terms of your choice of roaster. It‚Äôs a real shame I didn‚Äôt live here to try all these coffees out.</br>
									Additional note: these bakeries in Montreal really know how to make a croissant. Flavourful for sure, but to me, the most important bit was the texture. Most croissants I had here were soft and moist on the inside but still crispy on the outside. </p>

									<h2>Culinary Adventures</h2>
									<p>I look back on what I ate, but my friend and I cooked at home for the most part. We made a whole bunch of things ranging from curry, Ikea food, a charcuterie board (Montreal‚Äôs cheese selection üíØ), and random leftover mashup dishes.</p>

									<h3>Ma Poule Mouill√©e</h3>	
									<p>I forgot to take a photo of my own for this one so here‚Äôs one I found on the internet. This is Portuguese chicken poutine. It felt akin to putting Costco rotisserie chicken thigh meat on a poutine. If you know what those two things taste like separately, you can easily imagine what the chicken poutine tastes like. Thumbs up from me.</p>

									<h3>Montreal Smoked Meat Sandwich</h3>
									<p>My first bout of Montreal smoked meat was the ham version they sell at Sobeys. The first bite of this sandwich immediately told me that these two meats were completely different. While Sobeys‚Äô smoked meat has a soft texture and a light flavour, Montreal‚Äôs smoked meat was incredibly salty and the meat was on the drier side. It came with a whole pickle, and half a spoon of mustard slathered on the bread, which was not even close to nearly enough for a good balance. Although that being said, there was something quite addicting about the whole experience. A cold beer to go alongside would fit the bill I think. </p>

									<h3>Gol's Lanzhou Noodle</h3>
									<p>I love Gol‚Äôs. The flavour of the broth, the meat, and the texture of the noodles is just so good. Imagine my surprise when I found out they had a Gol‚Äôs in Montreal too. Apparently it was the first Gol‚Äôs in Canada before they started expanding out of Montreal. They had less noodle thickness options, but otherwise it tastes just like any other Gol‚Äôs. </p>

								<p><span class="image right"><img class="image_overlay" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/sc-travel-blog/blog-montreal/la_binerie.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<h3>La Binerie</h3>
									<p>A baked bean restaurant. Their specialty was ‚Äúf√®ves au lard‚Äù, a Quebecois dish - think British baked beans with less sauce, and more pork fat. I took a photo of the food but not the beans itself - oops. Good food overall, if you enjoy full english breakfasts, this one's for you.</p>
								</p>
								<div style="clear: both;"></div>

								<h3>J√©r√¥me Ferrer</h3>
								<p>Definitely one of the highlights of the trip. J√©r√¥me Ferrer, a fine dining restaurant, had a special deal where if you were celebrating becoming 22 in 2024, you could snag a free meal at their restaurant. I love myself a good fine dining splurge every once in a while, but one for free? It almost seemed too good to be true. But alas it was very true, and what was even better was that anything on the menu was free, including the course meal. A lot of interesting visuals and tasty food, but I‚Äôm not quite sure if I would‚Äôve been happy with the $140 price tag it would have cost me otherwise.</p>

									<p>Beyond the vast array of culinary delights, Montreal‚Äôs daily life had its own unique charm. I had the opportunity to work in Old Montreal where it gets pretty quiet.</p>

									<h2>Old Montreal</h2>
								</header>
								<p>The touristy spots were very tourist-heavy, but the spots just outside of the ‚Äúmain area‚Äù around the Notre-Dame Basilica are wonderful. Brick paths lined the pedestrian area, and the stone-brick heavy buildings resembled ones you would find in fantasy video games. I tried to look up the architecture style that Old Montreal uses, but I couldn‚Äôt find a definite answer. The closest I got was ‚ÄúQuebecois stone buildings‚Äù, which Google images gave similar results to Montreal‚Äôs buildings. </p>

								</div>
								<p>The commute to work from my friend‚Äôs place was something that made my morning special. Imagine this: you wake up in the morning and peek outside; clear skies, sun shining brightly, warm day forecasted. You grab yourself a rental bike and off to work. It‚Äôs a relaxing ride as there‚Äôs barely any elevation change, and Montreal‚Äôs roads are set up such that there's always a sectioned-off part of the road just for bikes. The fresh morning breeze paired with bright sunlight can boost anyone‚Äôs mood instantly. Did I mention you bike alongside the river? It‚Äôs a great start to the day.</p>
								<div class="row">

									<div class="col-6"><span class="image fit"><img class="image_overlay" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/sc-travel-blog/blog-montreal/commute2.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
								</div>
								<p>Unfortunately, because of how the weather works, not every day is sunny. Sometimes it‚Äôs rainy. Sometimes you forget to check the weather before leaving, so when the clock hits 5pm, it‚Äôs pouring outside and now you have to bike home in the rain. Unfortunately the first half of the trip was great, but Montreal quickly became cold and wet.

									<h2>Afterword</h2>
								</header>
								<p>My trip to Montreal was special for a multitude of reasons, but the things that stood out to me the most was cafe culture, and how the city felt to be in. I did end up spending a majority of my time at work, so most of my afternoons weren‚Äôt very productive. When I did return to my friend‚Äôs apartment, all I wanted to do was to eat dinner and relax. Maybe grab a couple beers from the SAQ (Quebec's LCBO). If I were to go again, I definitely think I‚Äôll do some more research on food recommendations. </p>
